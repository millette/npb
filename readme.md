# Next.js + PouchDB demo

`Next.js` is a JavaScript framework to build React applications with `SSR`.

`PouchDB` is a JavaScript implementation of `CouchDB` for the browser (client-side) and `nodejs`.

The goal of this demo is to handle PouchDB client-side with server-side rendering and allow server-side replication too.
